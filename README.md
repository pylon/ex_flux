# ExFlux

An [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/)
driver that is designed from the ground up to bend, not break under load. In order to accomplish this there were three major design goals:

1. Effectively utilize the [InfluxDB UDP
   protocol](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/services/udp/README.md)
   by making batched writes a part of the library.
2. Support the complete [Influx line
   protocol](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.4/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/)
   with proper escaping and type support
3. Handle load accountably and shed load in a defined [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) manner when stats cannot be shipped
   fast enough:
   -  prioritize casts over calls
   -  [drop datapoints from the queue, oldest first](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core.async/sliding-buffer), when the queue is full and all UDP socket workers are busy.

## Installation

Now [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ex_flux` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_flux, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Example

As explained in the [Influx UDP protocol](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/services/udp/README.md), InfluxDB specifies that a UDP port maps to
exactly one configured database. Example configuration for InfluxDB .conf files
can be found at the bottom of the [Influx udp protocol
page](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/services/udp/README.md#config-examples)

Create an `ExFlux.Database` in your project:
```elixir
defmodule YourApp.YourInfluxDatabase do
   use ExFlux.Database, otp_app: :your_app, database: "database_name"
end
```

Add it to your `application.ex`:
```elixir
      children = [
        ...,
        YourApp.YourInfluxDatabase
      ]
```

To add points in a series, use `ExFlux.Point`s or regular elixir maps interchangeably. A helper for defining series schema is a [Near Term TODO](https://github.com/pylon/ex_flux#near-term-todos).

```elixir
iex(1)> point = %{measurement: "series_name", fields: %{value: 1}, tags: %{}, timestamp: System.os_time(:nanosecond)}
iex(2)> YourApp.SpecificDatabase.push(point)
```

The point will be queued asynchronously and either flushed or sent as part of a batch.


## Near Term TODOs

* series specification
* timestamp granularity support
* test for load shedding
